                      Knowledge tooling is happily becoming a hot topic again. With this trend is coming revived interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xanadu</a>, bi-directional hyperlinking, knowledge databases, visualizing knowledge graphs, and so on. At this moment, I see most of the emphasis being put on tooling for the research side, with Notion, Workflowy, and the new and hyped Roam Research leading the way.
