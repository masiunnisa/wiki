-   Chains of [[Block]] that contain the information regarding the transactions that have taken place.
-   Distributed ledger technology [[DLT]] open to anyone
-   uses [[Cryptography]] and other set of mathematical algorithms to create data structure.
-   suprisingly, it is very secure as once the data is entered it becomes very difficult to change which prevents any 

## How does blockchain work?
- it requires a computer with perfectly installed software that are decentralized, with the copies of ledger distributed to each node 
- a [[Block]] is created each time a member updates the data. It is then transmitted to the other members in the network in an encrypted form i;e [[Cryptography]]
- then the process of [[consensus mechanism]] takes place.
- Decentralizing trust and enabling decentralised authentication of transactions are at the heart of blockchain. As a result, it eliminates the need for a "middleman."
